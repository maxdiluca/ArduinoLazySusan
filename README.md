# Arduino-based Lazy Susan

<p>This project has been funded by the Experimental Psychology Society and has been developed by <a href="https://massimilianodiluca.info/">Max Di Luca</a>.</p>

 Judgments about material properties (e.g., roughness, softness, temperature extraction) are acquired through direct contact between skin with a surface and through exploration. Presenting materials to participant can be an exhausting task for the experimenter, and mechanical automation is a desired methodology. Moreover, due to social distancing requirements, in-person experiments to study how the perception of these properties is achieved, might not be possible. To overcome these limitations, here we devised a setup that can be either used to present objects to participants, it could be mailed to participantsâ€™ homes with instructions on how to run the experiment and collect the data, or that can be employed in conjunction with a VR headset to create visual-haptic discrepancies between material properties.
 
 The device is built by combining an inexpensive lazy Susan with a microcontroller (Atmega168). Precisely manufactured 3D printed surfaces are mounted on the motorized lazy Susan and the microcontroller allows rapid selection of the appropriate sample.
